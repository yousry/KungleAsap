				+ "year's total of £13.2bn, but the fact that it came during a period where the banking system owed its"

				+ "'furore' Barclays and Lloyds to dish out millions in bonuses. City bonuses defy credit crunch and "
				+ "hit new record of £13bn. We are still mad with the banks but we are no closer to getting even. News"
				+ "of the huge sums being offered by Barclays to five traders at JP Morgan will also stoke the row. "
				+ "Barclays is close to poaching Todd Edgar, 37, a star commodity trader at JP Morgan, and his four "
				+ "team members to head up the foreign exchange trading desk. Mr Edgar is responsible for a $2bn book "
				+ "at JP Morgan and single-handedly made the US investment bank a $100m profit last year. At Barclays,"
				+ "the team will have an emerging markets focus, with two members based in Asia and Mr Edgar and the "
				+ "others operating out of London. They will also continue to trade commodities, but to a lesser degree"
				+ "than before. Barclays has offered the team a combined $25m in salaries and bonuses paid in cash "
				+ "guarantees and deferred stock. In addition, they will take a share of future profits that could lift"
				+ "the package to $50m. Market-leading rates on profit shares are currently 12pc, according to bankers,"
				+ "but Mr Edgar and his team are said to have been offered even more generous terms. Sources suggest Mr"
				+ "Edgar himself could receive up to half the total. It is understood the pay package does not "
				+ "contravene any of the Financial Service Authority's guidelines. At JP Morgan, Mr Edgar was largely a"
				+ "proprietary trader, gambling with the bank's own money. At Barclays, although he will take "
				+ "proprietary positions, his main role will be client business. Mr Edgar's appointment would follow "
				+ "public outrage last week over a £7m \"market leading\" deal agreed by Royal Bank of Scotland, 70pc "
				+ "owned by the taxpayer, for a Merrill Lynch banker, Antonio Polverino. Although Barclays has not "
				+ "taken any cash directly from the state, critics say it is the beneficiary of £1.2 trillion of "
				+ "taxpayer support for the financial system as a whole. Senior Treasury officials believe that the "
				+ "bank would have collapsed were it not for their assistance. In an interview this weekend, the Shadow"
				+ "Chancellor, George Osborne said it was \"totally unacceptable\" that the major banks are paying "
				+ "large bonuses on the back of taxpayer guarantees. Mr Osborne said: \"There are hundreds of billions "
				+ "of pounds of guarantees in existence: guarantees provided by the taxpayer to all banks. The reason "
				+ "those guarantees are in place is not so the bankers can pay themselves large bonuses. \"The scale of"
				+ "this year's bonus payments, as revealed by the ONS statistics, would be enough to finance an almost "
				+ "2p reduction in the basic rate of income tax. The payments came after the unprecedented bail-out of "
				+ "British banks, which cost the taxpayer some £35bn in capital infusions. Lord Oakeshott, Liberal "
				+ "Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: \"These figures suggest that the bankers are taking most of the "
				+ "profits and the taxpayer is taking most of the risk. \"The official confirmation of the scale of "
				+ "City bonuses in the past year underlines the fact that even against the backdrop of the worst "
				+ "financial crisis in British history, bankers awarded themselves bonuses which were still "
				+ "significantly larger, even in nominal terms, than those handed out five years ago in 2004, when the "
				+ "City was entering the credit boom. Barclays and JP Morgan declined to comment.",
